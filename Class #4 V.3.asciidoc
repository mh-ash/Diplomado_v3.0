### **CLASS #*4* - BITCOIN**

**Why was Bitcoin created?**

The 2001 attack on the Twin Towers in New York was a huge blow to the world economy. As a consequence, with the support of the private sector and the objective of facilitating mortgage financing for people with lower incomes, the US began to rapidly lower interest rates to levels never seen before. In this way, credits were given to people without income, assets, or employment. This type of mortgage was baptized as "subprime mortgage", and of course, they had a high probability of default. The effects of the crisis are lived until today. Its outbreak occurred on September 15, 2008, when the investment bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. From that moment on, the United States suffered an economic collapse and then the rest of the developed countries followed. Consequently, day by day mistrust in banks grew due to excessive risk taking and little regulation in the industry.

 

üí° **The problems to be solved?**

- The lack of individual sovereignty,
- the centralization of banks,
- inflation, surveillance,
- the need for intermediaries,
- the lack of accessibility to banking services and
- the high costs of international remittances, among others.

**How were they solved? ** 

- With the use of a technology developed in 1991,


**Who solved them? **

- Satoshi Nakamoto appeared in October 2008. His identity is still a mystery.
- He proposed his idea of a new electronic cash system. This money would be called **bitcoin**.
- He devoted his time to creating a guide to explain a new means of payment that:
    - enables the execution of fast and low-cost value transfers,
    - cannot be controlled or manipulated by governments or financial institutions
- Thanks to this being or group of people, there is a solution to the problem of "**double spending":**
    - ****Now it is impossible for anyone to spend the same virtual money in two different places.
- A nine-page document known as the **Whitepaper** .
    - He shared it to the Cypherpunk email list:
        - a very active group with technical discussions
            - they included mathematics, cryptography, computer science, political and philosophical discussions and even personal arguments.

- Satoshi had a cynicism towards the traditional monetary and banking system.
    - This can be seen in the **genesis block,** where he published a message that said:

> "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."
> 

- Satoshi Nakamoto, Genesis Block.  

- It refers to an article in the Times newspaper entitled "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."
-  British Chancellor had to decide whether to inject billions of British Pounds more into the economy in order to rescue the banks.

This is other basic data we know about Satoshi, his Whitepaper and the creation of Bitcoin:

- The first bitcoin transaction was from Nakamoto to Hal Finney.
- Satoshi's last "sign of life" was with Gavin Andersen, software developer:
    
    > ‚Äú‚Ä¶I've moved on to other things,‚Ä¶It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.‚Äù
    > 
- In public messages, and even in private messages that were later published, Nakamoto never spoke of anything personal. It was all about bitcoin and its **code**.
- Many people claimed to be Satoshi. We still don't know who he is.
-  It is estimated that Satoshi has approximately 980,000 bitcoins.

**What challenges did Satoshi face? **

- [ ]  Could someone send the same money to two people at the same time?
- [ ]  On the internet, who can trust who is on the other side?
- [ ]  How do we know if someone has enough money in their account (or wallet) to buy one product from another?
- [ ]  How do you ensure that a decentralized network can make the right decisions, even if some of the ** nodes** (connected participants) in it become dishonest?
- [ ]  Can we create a distributed and reliable system that does not automatically assume that the participants will act ethically and work in the interest of the group?
- [ ]  How do we know that the person who wants to receive money through this system is who he claims to be?

‚Äù**Double Spend Problem‚Äù = "Byzantine Generals Problem"**

**What was the Byzantine Generals problem?**

The problem of the Byzantine Generals is a metaphor that narrates the difficulty of transmitting reliable information without the intervention of a trusted central coordinator.

What is the story?

- [ ]  There was a castle in Persia, which is very well supplied and fortified.
- [ ]  The Byzantine generals surrounded the castle and plan to launch an attack.
- [ ]  Since the army is so dispersed, there is no centralized control.
- [ ]  The generals communicate with each other through messengers.
- [ ]  The two possible commands are "attack" and "retreat".
- [ ]  They must agree to attack the Persian army, and do so simultaneously.
- [ ]  If any of them attack separately, they will lose the battle
- [ ]  If there is a traitor, it could cause the loyalists to disagree.
    - [ ]  For example, you could tell one general to attack and the other to retreat.
- [ ]  One morning, a general receives the following message: "The attack will take place on Tuesday." ****Does not bear the signature of any central authority.


 How can the general be sure that it is a true order and not a deception of the enemy transmitting information contrary to the strategy of the army?

What happens if the one who sent the message is a traitor and plans to betray the army? What happens if the general himself is corrupt and seeks to sow discord among the other generals?

The solution to this problem was originally used as a method to avoid email spam. 

**What does this have to do with Bitcoin? **

The problem of the Byzantine generals describes:

- The difficulty that decentralized systems have in agreeing on a single truth.
- It is the same as when you make a money transfer without a reliable intermediary.
    - A way is then required to verify that the message has not been modified, which had not been achieved until the appearance of Bitcoin with its **consensus** mechanism.
- The use of cryptography is essential in this process, but what is **cryptography**?
    - The art of creating **messages encrypted with secret keys** so that they cannot be decrypted except by the person to whom it is addressed or who has the key.
- Bitcoin also uses a **proof of work** mechanism and a **blockchain** to solve the ‚Äú**double spend**‚Äù problem.
- Bitcoin achieves:

1) transfer a digital asset (or money) to another user through the Internet,

2) so that only the owner can start the operation,

3) only the recipient can receive it,

4) everyone can validate the transfer,

5) and this is recognized by all participants,

6) it is immutable, or impossible to reverse or delete,

7)¬† all this is done in a totally **distributed** and **decentralized** way.

Within the framework of blockchains, each General is a **node in the network**, 

- The nodes must reach an agreement
    - to determine the current status of the shared accounting record.
    - If the majority of the **network** on the **blockchain** agrees,
        - mmodify the balances of accounts payable and receivable from users,
    - If a large majority of the network is malicious,
        - the system is vulnerable to failures.

### *Introduction to Bitcoin*

Let's start with a short video:

What is Bitcoin and how does it work? https://youtu.be/S2HxMK7iO4c

What is Bitcoin? What is bitcoin?‚Ä¶..

It's a lot of things‚Ä¶. 

- **Money**: A virtual and intangible currency that fulfills the three functions of traditional money: a unit of account, a value deposit and a means of exchange.
- **Software**: Software that you can download and run on any computer.
    - A **payment system** without a central bank or a single authority.
- **Network**: Set of people and computers working through consensus to function without failure.
    
    
    - What is the difference between Bitcoin and bitcoin?
        - Bitcoin with 'B' refers to the **network** of computers that works with the same program, while *bitcoin* with 'b' refers to the digital asset ($) that is managed within the network. In other words, bitcoin is a unit of virtual currency encrypted by cryptography, which serves us to exchange value within the Bitcoin network.
    
- What is its main function?
    - Allows the transfer of peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, without intermediaries, economically, and without international barriers. It stores value.
- What technological progress has it achieved? Why will it revolutionize banking?
    - Prevents people from spending the same money twice.
    - Eliminates the need for a central authority to monitor transactions.
- What makes it valuable?
    
    
- What is the relationship between the blockchain and Bitcoin?
    - The blockchain is the public ledger where the most important Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded.
    - Bitcoin is the only blockchain that records transactions made with the bitcoin currency.
    
    
- What are *bitcoins* made of?
    - Nothing that can be physically touched, like a voucher.
    - They are only strings of numbers and digital letters
    - A unique identity (just as your fingerprint gives you your identity).
- Is Bitcoin anonymous?
    - No, it's a pseudonym. Transactions are visible, accessible and transparent to everyone.
    - People identify themselves not with name and surname but with strings of letters and numbers
- Who can use Bitcoin?
    - Unlike the traditional banking system, anyone who has access to the internet.
- How can I get bitcoin?
    - It is **purchased** online through platforms called **exchanges**.
    - New bitcoins are **created** through a work process called **mining.**
- What are the barriers to Bitcoin?
    - Internet access is required to be able to make transactions with BTC.
    - Some countries prohibit entries but it is impossible to prohibit the exchange.
- Where are the bitcoins stored?
    - In a wallet with access to our private keys or in an exchange.
- How can a currency that does not exist in the physical world and that is not supported by anything, or by anyone, have value?
    - Value grows with confidence, scarcity, utility and level of demand, among other factors.
- Is Bitcoin safe?
    - The objective of mining is to discourage bad actors and hinder unwanted behaviors such as double spending or spam.
    - Cryptography protects information in a very secure way. It uses:
        - public keys (similar to the # of a bank account but unique in each transaction)
        - and private keys (similar to a secret PIN belonging to that bank account)
- Who and what ensures that transactions are executed without failure?
    - Miners and mining.
    - The goal is to discourage bad actors and hinder unwanted behavior.
- What are some of the advantages of bitcoin over fiat?
    - The price of bitcoin is the same in all countries of the world.
    - There are no borders.
    - Its inflation is controlled and its emission is predefined.
    - Governments have no decision-making power over its governance.

Practical Exercise (continuation of [Is it a Good Monetary Asset?]

If you had difficulties with the previous exercise, review the table ‚ÄúDifferences between Bitcoin and Fiat‚Äù.

## ***Bitcoin participants:**

To understand how someone or a system participates in the Bitcoin network, we must ask ourselves

- Can this person or computer only see the transactions in which it participates?
    - Do they have access to more information?
- What are the transactions they can make?
- What are the permissions they have on the network?
- How does they interact with the network?
- Do they have access to a copy of the entire chain?


1. **Miners**: Specialized computer equipment 
    - They compete in solving mathematical puzzles with each other, to create new bitcoins.
    -They confirm transactions and maintain the security of the network.
        - Similar to employees in a bank; they are paid for their work
2. **Exchanges**: They exchange fiat coins for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
    - They offer a way to get in and out of the market for those who are not miners.
    - Similar to banks; offer services to users
3. **Wallets**: Applications used to store, send and receive bitcoin.
    - Similar to bank accounts or apps to transfer money online
4. **Nodes**: Devices connected to a digital network that validate, transmit, process and store BTC transactions. (In addition to being wallets, they have many other functions)
    - They consist of two things: hardware and software. (Similar to a mobile phone and an app)
        - Hardware is the physical material necessary to run the software.
- **Developers**: They maintain and propose improvements to the code.
