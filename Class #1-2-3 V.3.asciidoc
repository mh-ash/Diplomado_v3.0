# The Monetary System

### Activity ‚ÄúIntroduction to money‚Äù

## What problems are there with today's money?

We are programmed to resist the challenges of life and progress. It is a natural human process to want to improve ourselves, to lead a productive, creative and valuable life, but:

- We live in a world where there is a lot for a few, and very little for the many.
    - Individuals with lower economic resources:
        - They don't have the same opportunities. Why?
            - they do not have access to the same levels of education,
            - they can't access the necessary credits to start their business.

To reduce poverty and stimulate social well-being, it is important to:

- improve access to financial education,
- develop the ability to manage money,
- learn how to use new technologies responsibly
- plan for the future.

We will see that Bitcoin is a tool and a type of money:

- transparent, decentralized, global, digital, cheap, private, programmable, easy and fast access, which can help remedy these problems.

**Consequences of the development of our civilization**

People have always needed someone to finance their aspirations for the future.

- Ways to exchange wages, time, and energy for valuables.

If we had not evolved, we would have been reduced to a barter economy. 

- Everything that someone would want to buy would have to be exchanged for something that that person could provide.

Permanent development has revolutionized societies and global interaction

- In general, with a common interest in improving the quality of life of future civilizations
    - As technology advances and productivity increases, it should:
        - lower prices naturally
        - strengthen the currency
        - to be able to buy more for less.
    - But the opposite happens.
        - Prices go up, coins weaken and we buy less for more
    
- How did we get here?
- How, and why is more money created and what are the consequences?
- What is hidden behind the financial systems today?
- *What is the invisible danger of the loss of value of money? *
- *How can we give additional value to our savings*?

Today, only banks and governments have the power to emit money in an economy.

The money just doesn't run out. Governments print the amount of money needed to finance their public spending, inject resources into the economy and then withdraw them in the form of taxes. 

The problem is that as humanity, we spend more than we generate. As a consequence:

- loss of confidence in the value of money and in the modern banking system.
- global economic and political instability and even wars. Why?

### **Our needs are endless but our resources are scarce.**



**Modernization** 

> ‚Äò*Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.' -Satoshi Nakamoto*


The banking business consists of: 

- The purchase of money in the form of savings from savers, and its subsequent sale through loans to those who need it.
- Its benefit, as in any other business, comes from:
    - A higher selling price than the purchase price-
        - the interest rate of the money you lend is higher than the one you pay to lenders.
    - But the key to banking power **** lies in the possibility of:
        - sell something that is not your property**,** but the corresponding saver.
- Governments control the issuance of their coins
    - they try to solve problematic economic cycles
- Economies print more money in times of recession
    - stimulate growth in the short term
    - short-term unemployment decreases
- The need for physical paper money has lost its importance
    - Internet banking has facilitated the use of credit


üí° **The Benefits**

- They facilitate immediate transactions and planning for the future
- They record the movements of savers and debtors in centralized databases
- They constantly update the outputs and inputs of their users
- They verify the legitimacy of the accounts
- If the money disappears in an account for one of several reasons, it is replaceable.
    - They have insurance policies in case they are victims of a robbery.

üí° **The Costs.**

- The banking system has a single source of failure, it is centralized and can be easily manipulated.
   
    
- Governments can:
    - freely expand and contract the money supply
    - confiscate bank accounts,
    - block withdrawals without prior notice,
    - face serious technical problems or hacking,
    - eliminate some basic services,
    - maneuver interest rates and taxes
    - High inflation and negative interest rates cause the value of money to decrease


> ‚ÄúA bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella in fair weather and ask for it back when it begins to rain.‚Äù (Robert Lee Frost)

### Definition of Money

We accept payments in cash, check and/or credit card in exchange for goods and services

- *No* we stop to think that:
    - all these means of exchange are only promises of payment.

What is money? https://youtu.be/2yCIKkq8gKA

**Functions of Money**

Money fulfills **three functions**: 

1. Deposit of value that can be invested, saved, requested or lent 
2. means of exchange to pay for goods and services 
3. unit of measurement that allows you to compare prices between products or services.

Value Deposit

- **Definition:** It tends to maintain its value over time.

Means of exchange

- **Definition:** Eliminates the complex barter system allowing the exchange of goods and the payment of debts with greater efficiency.

Unit of measurement

- **Definition:** Allows there to be a universal pattern of a pricing system to express the value of goods and services.


**Characteristics of Money.**

Money can take many forms. The more of these characteristics for a type of money, the better money it is.

**Durability** Money must resist physical deterioration and last over time. It must be able to circulate in the economy in an acceptable and recognizable state.


**Uniformity or fungibility** - Each unit of money must be exactly the same as any other. 


**Portability** It has to be easy to move from one place to another. You must be able to accumulate, or transport, a lot of value in a small weight.


**Divisability** It must be used to acquire expensive and inexpensive goods and be divided without losing its value.


**Recognisability** or **Acceptability**- The good used has to be recognized by everyone as money.


**Scarcity** The value of money depends on supply and demand. The more money is offered and the less it is needed, its value will be lower**. ** 


**CONVENTIONAL MONEY and MONETARY ASSETS** 

- **conventional money** is the money of general use in a particular country.
    - Cash in circulation, bank deposits and central bank reserves.
    - Most are credit or electronic entries in the accounting books.
    - **DO NOT NECESSARILY** save ****your **VALUE** over **time**
    
- The ** MONETARY ASSETS** generally **MAY** keep ****their **VALUE** in the **time**.

**Types of money:**

- Money **Merchandise**:
    - difficult to extract, scarce
    - attractive as a reserve of value
    - gold and silver endured as good money for thousands of years
    
    **Monetary Activity** 
    
- **Representative**:
    - banknotes backed by gold or silver
    - each ticket is exchanged for its equivalent value in metal
    - In modern history, the gold standard lasted until 1971.
    
    **Monetary Assets (Initially)**
    
    **Conventional Money (Thing by the passage of time-**if the money supply increases**)** 
    
- **Fiat or fiat currency**:
    - Implemented as a monopoly and issued at will by a government
    - it is not backed by a physical product
    - it has no intrinsic value; its value depends on:
        - the relationship between supply and demand
        - the stability of the issuing government.
    
    **Conventional Money (**The digital fiat has more counterparty risk than the physical one**)**
    
- **Bitcoin**:
    - digital currency
    - operates in a decentralized way
    - is based on software and "person to person" cryptography to perform movements.
    
    **Monetary Activity**
    

**Practical Exercise.**  Mark with an X if the item meets the indicated feature. Which item would you choose as money? 

(Let's not fill in the last 'Bitcoin' column until the fourth chapter is completed.)

Is it a good monetary asset? 

Useful money must be portable, divisible, durable, scarce, recognizable and fungible

# History, Evolution and Devaluation of Money

# History of Money

Money is something we use every day, but we rarely stop to think... where did it come from? How did our ancestors deal? 

- What has constituted as money has changed over time and from one place to another.
- Money is as old as language
    - It's just a form of communication, a technology.
- There is no universal agreement on what it really is.
- In principle, we would not need a special asset such as a ticket to recognize who is owed goods and/or services.
    - Anyone could have their own ledger.
    - Our ancestors traded in this way and/or through barter without the need for banks or conventional money.

**Let's go back to the past: The Barter**

To produce the barter, there must be a **double coincidence of needs**. 

- A person who wants to exchange something needs to find a business partner who has what he wants and wants what he has.
- This means of exchange of goods and services requires a lot of time, restricts economic activity and limits specialization.
- The use of money alleviates these problems.

- Money has evolved throughout history, facing challenges and changing needs...
    - Normally, the form of money that offered the superior characteristics was chosen.
    - But since coins and the transition from precious metals to paper-backed metals began to be cut...
        - we went from a natural selection of the best-performing form of money,
        - one of ease of use, greater portability and divisibility.
    - There was a change towards centralization.
    
    ### Sudden change to the Fiat
    
    The industrial era marked the beginning of centralization:
    
    - The objective was to correctly distribute the goods produced
        - The Central Banks were created
        - The credit and debit card system was born
    
    When money is centralized, deep problems can occur. 
    
    - The governments closely monitor the economic activity of their citizens
    - Abuse of power can lead to
        - economic incentives and government interventions
        - explosion of debt and irresponsible consumption
            - Increase in wealth inequality
    
    - Until 1971, representative money was used: means of exchange and store of value.
    - We move away from solid money towards a debt-based world
        - Richard Nixon, eliminated the free convertibility of gold for money
        - Let's move on to the current experiment, which is the money **fiat**.
        - Modern money is by decree and not by consensus.
            - **Fiat** comes from Latin and means by decree: it is elected and established by law
            

> "What worked yesterday, will not necessarily work today." Jordan Peterson


**Central Banks**

- **The objective and function of the Central Bank:**
    - Controls the country's monetary policy in order to ensure stability
    - Central Banks function: To be the banker of the banks.
    - Central Banks main job: to manipulate the supply of money in circulation
        - **Control inflation and maximize employment with economic and financial policies**
    - The US Central Bank is called the Federal Reserve.
    
    - Who defines and who benefits from these objectives?
        - Large banks - can influence federal, and even global policies.
    - How does the Federal Reserve alter the money supply?
        - Through the ** fractional reserve** banking system,
        - Banks in the United States only keep 10% of their deposits in their reserves.
        - Fractional reserve banking results in a bank multiplier**
        - More than two people use the same money at the same time in a country's economy.
            
           
            üí° Banks are obliged to maintain a certain percentage of all deposits in the bank. Reducing that percentage means that more money can circulate, and increasing it means that less money circulates.
            
           
            
        
    - What problems can the ** fractional reserve bank cause? **
        - Banks "borrow and lend in the long term."
            - The withdrawal of deposits exceeds cash reserves.
            - Banks incur large losses
            - In the worst case, there is a bank run.
        - Changes in interest rates or the cost of capital affect the risk.
            - + money in circulation... cheaper and less demanding loans.
        
    - Open market operations (to increase or decrease the money in circulation)
        - The government buys or sells monetary securities (high-liquidity debt).
            - If you want to increase it: they buy treasury bonds.
            - If you want to reduce it: they sell treasury bonds

Follow the teacher's instructions for the following activity.

### Inflation

In an introductory way, we will analyze the following video about what inflation is:

https://youtu.be/gkDQGribCfc

Resource: *Causes of Inflation*, Video, Banco de la Rep√∫blica, Colombia

- **Definition**:
    - Originally, the term was used to indicate:
        - the loss of value of a currency,
        - the devaluation of its purchasing power caused by the increase in its supply.
    - This loss of value normally produces, in terms of said currency:
        - a general and sustained increase in the price of all goods and services
    - The term "inflation" was also used to indicate the price increase
        - regardless of the cause.
    
     **Why do we care?**
    
    - When more money is pursued by the same amount of goods:
        - prices go up.
    - If product prices increase faster than wages and salaries:
        - People become impoverished.

        **McDonald's in 2022:**
    
    
    

**What do modern economists teach us?**

- We need to stimulate inflation in order to effectively manage a nation.
- If we do not encourage spending and investment (through the devaluation of the currency):
    - we risk a lower demand,
    - unleashing a decreased production and
    - leading in the worst case to a stagnant economy.
    - All this implies that it is difficult, impossible or even not recommendable to save.
- The current situation encourages us to spend. It's a counterproductive theory.
    - We don't think about a future beyond a couple of days, weeks or months
    - We should be able to prepare for the future of our grandchildren
    - Inflation simply does not allow us to have financial discipline.
- Our decisions have consequences.
    - This is known as **"opportunity cost"**
    
    - Inflation encourages a **High Time Preference,** which means that we prefer $100 today instead of $200 in two years.
    
  
    - Our goal should be to create a **low time preference. **
    
   
    
    We see the following three reasons why inflation occurs:
    
    https://youtu.be/_DpyCXNiY7E
    
    Resource: *Causes of Inflation,* Video, Banco de la Rep√∫blica, Colombia
    
    1. **Inflation of costs and supply**
    - Increase the price of inputs
        - Causes:
            - Government regulations, wars, droughts, supply chain difficulties and other situations.
            - Increase in tax rates increase the cost of raw materials
            - Specialized jobs become more expensive
                - lack of skills or resources in a society
            - New technologies are usually very expensive
                - Over time, the cost of the products decreases.
    1. **Demand Inflation**
        1. The supply of goods is not enough to meet the demand
        2. Due to a reduction in taxes or a reduction in interest rates on loans) 
            - an increase in disposable income is created...
            - the excess begins to circulate in the market...
            - you compete to get the same goods with more money...
                - this raises prices...
        - eventually the supply increases, and then the prices go down again.
    
    1. **Inflation by government policies**
    - The government finances the deficit with issuance
        - Are the jobs/projects created through inflation authentic?
        - Why is it important for governments that people buy things with their money?
        - What types of goods do we buy as a society when there is more money in the economy? Are they essential goods to live?
        - What happens when tax rates rise faster than the increase in wages in an economy?
    
    - Inflation means that the work you did a while ago has less value than today.
        - Last year you were paid $10; you could buy 10 lunches for $1 each.
        - You decided to save your money.
        - Today there is:
            - more money in circulating in the economy
            - more people wanting to buy lunches
            - the same number of lunches for sale
            - the price rises to $2 for lunch.
        - You can only buy 5 lunches with the $10 dollars you saved.
        - In theory, this doesn't make sense. If you put 8 hours of work, that reality does not change even if 10 years have passed. That energy should be able to stay with you.
        - We could say that inflation is a type of value theft.
        

In the following graph we can see the loss of value of the American dollar. 


Resource: 

*Declining purchasing power of the US dollar strengthens Bitcoin,* https://cryptopotato.com/is-there-a-pattern-between-usd-dow-jones-and-bitcoin/, Toju Ometoruwa

- **Inflation through time**
    - Inflation between 1970 and 2020 was much higher than that of the previous 50-year period, 1920 to 1970.
    - What will happen if we continue in the same trajectory?
    - Who had a greater economic hardship, the generation of your grandparents or that of your parents?
    
    - $1 from 1920 to 1970:
        
       
    - $1 from 1970 to 2020:
            

 

Do you think salaries went up at the same rate as prices? 


In other words, what we can buy today (2022) with $100 would have cost us approximately $7 in 1920. 

Inflation causes a loss in **purchasing power:** 

- increases in wages are lower than increases in food prices
- individuals are forced to reduce their consumption
- the purchasing capacity is reduced.

### Surveillance

Governments impose regulations in order to find and trap people who launder money or make other illegal transactions. 

- Surveillance is a double-edged sword.
- The more fraud occurs, the more vigilance by the State and private companies
    - invade our privacy thanks to technological progress
    - control our movements on social and economic networks
    - Exchange of personal data in exchange for the enjoyment of certain services.
- Consequences:
    - digital scams, online harassment, extortion, identity theft and other problems that endanger the privacy and security of users.
    - Our card purchases are recorded, analyzed and monitored
        - unless we buy goods and services in cash
- If someone gets your password from your internet banking, or hacks the centralized servers, they would have access to all of your information.

üí° We need money that protects our privacy and does not share all our personal information with governments and private companies.

### Restriction

- It's difficult and expensive to move money between nations.
- Governments control foreign exchange, even if it is done between two known people.

Here is a list of policies and ways in which this can happen:

- **Governmental policies**
    - Capital Control: The amount of money that your citizens can transfer, exchange or take abroad is restricted.
        - Examples:
            - Argentina, Russia, Indonesia, Cuba and China
            - The average citizen of China can only convert up to $ 50,000 in renminbi (approx. $8,000 USD) each year.
    
    > ‚Äú*The only solution we have found in Cuba is Bitcoin. We are currently in the same equality, the same possibility of competing with any other country, because we have full, free, unsanctioned access to that technology that allows us to create, grow and connect.‚Äù*
    > 
    
       *Eric Garc√≠a Cruz, Cuban entrepreneur and Bitcoin enthusiast. *
    
- **Banking Policies**
    - Banks have limits on the amount of cash that can be withdrawn from an account, or they have a maximum that can be transferred.
    - Most of these transactions have commissions
        - Grecia, tras la crisis de 2015, sus ciudadanos solo pod√≠an retirar $60 euros al d√≠a,
            - este es un claro recordatorio de qui√©n realmente controla tu dinero.
        - En El Salvador, la remesas representan el 23% de su producto interno bruto (PIB).
            - En el 2020 fueron casi $6 mil millones de d√≥lares. Alrededor del 60% de ese dinero proviene de empresas de remesas y el 38% de instituciones bancarias.
            - Empresas como Western Union tienen tarifas elevadas,
                - especialmente para montos inferiores a $1000 USD.
- **Comisiones o cargos**
    
    Solo enriquecen a las instituciones bancarias e
    
    Incrementan la brecha entre ricos y pobres
    
    - Para montos peque√±os, como de diez d√≥lares,
        - las comisiones pueden llegar a ser  hasta de m√°s de tres d√≥lares, o el 33%.
    - Para cien d√≥lares,
        - las tarifas oscilan entre el 12% y el 15%.
    
- **Horario**
    
    Para enviar/recibir una remesa:
    
    - tanto el remitente como el destinatario deben acudir a la sucursal m√°s cercana
        - durante horario laboral, por supuesto
- **Seguridad**
    
    Acudir a las oficinas de Western Union representa riesgos adicionales, 
    
    - las personas deben llevar su dinero en efectivo,
        - aumentando las posibilidades de ser robados.
    - Si los servidores centralizados fallan (lo que pasa frecuentemente),
        - se podr√≠an negar el acceso a los fondos de cualquier cliente.
    

### Centralizaci√≥n vs. Decentralizaci√≥n

La centralizaci√≥n de las econom√≠as modernas produce:

- censura, abuso de poder, corrupci√≥n, desigualdad de oportunidades, desigualdad de riqueza, y fuentes √∫nicas de fallos.

Los bancos operan por medio de  servidores centralizados, 

- tienen acceso todas las actividades financieras de sus usuarios.

Qu√© saben los bancos de sus clientes?

- cu√°nto te pagan,
- en qu√© gastas tu dinero,
- a qui√©n le mandas dinero
- y todo lo relacionado con tu cuenta bancaria.

**Caracter√≠sticas de un sistema centralizado**
1. Tienes que confiar que la organizaci√≥n centralizada mantendr√° tus datos seguros
2. Tienen completo control del sistema y de tus datos
3. Si los servidores principales se ven comprometidos, tus datos est√°n en riesgo. 

Las divisas digitales de los bancos centrales son la continuaci√≥n del sistema actual pero de forma digital. Es decir: mutables, censurables, cerradas, centralizadas, exclusivas, y vigilantes.

**C√≥mo contrarrestamos estos fen√≥menos, causados por malas pol√≠ticas gubernamentales?**


- **Caracter√≠sticas de un sistema descentralizado.** Se describe c√≥mo un sistema de **igual a igual** o de P2P porque:
    1. Las personas no tienen que identificarse para interactuar y estar interconectados entre s√≠ a trav√©s de internet. 
    2. Cada quien es responsable de su propio dispositivo pero presta y comparte sus recursos.
    3. Si hay un ataque a la red, los hackers tendr√≠an que tener control de la mayor√≠a de computadores ‚Äî esto es casi imposible.
    4. En caso de que hubiera un error en un servidor, el resto no se ver√≠a afectado.
    5. Logra una sociedad m√°s justa -quita el control a las corporaciones poderosas.

### **Conclusi√≥n**

Discusi√≥n en clase: Cuatro fen√≥menos globales que suceden hoy, gracias a la centralizaci√≥n:

- - La p√©rdida de poder adquisitivo
- - La restricci√≥n de la transferencia de valor
- - La p√©rdida de privacidad
- - Centralizaci√≥n financiera

Pregunt√©monos de nuevo, ¬øhabr√° soluci√≥n?
